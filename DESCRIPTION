Description: Implements an MCMC sampler for the posterior distribution of arbitrary time-homogeneous multivariate stochastic differential equation (SDE) models with possibly latent components.  The package provides a simple entry point to integrate user-defined models directly with the sampler's C++ code, and parallelizes large portions of the calculations when compiled with 'OpenMP'.
